# This script computes the attractors of a single,
# fully specified Boolean network. This includes both fixed points
# and complex attractors. However, it is typically faster to compute
# fixed points using the dedicated method and then check the remaining
# state space for complex attractors. See also
# `attractors_and_fixed_points.py` for more info.
#
# The script either prints the number of solutions, or the
# fist N solutions, assuming N is given as a second argument.
# In such case, it prints the smallest enclosing subspace of the attractor.
#
# Note that if the network has constant nodes, we can automatically
# percolate them without changing the outcome. However, this is not
# enabled by default to ensure all nodes are present in the result.
# You can uncomment this modification below.
#
# Also note that computing only first X attractors is not faster
# than computing the total result. I.e. the "time to first" and
# "time to all" is the same for this implementation.
#
# You can use `.aeon`, `.bnet`, or `.sbml` as input model formats.
#
# Print the attractor count:
# ```
# python3 attractors.py ./path/to/network.aeon
# ```
#
# Print first 1000 attractors:
# ```
# python3 attractors.py ./path/to/network.aeon 1000
# ```
