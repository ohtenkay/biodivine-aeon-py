# AEON.py examples

Here, we give several examples on how to use AEON.py to solve problems related to Boolean networks.
Currently, the examples are split into workflows and case studies.

Each workflow shows how to solve a particular problem using AEON.py. Each case study focuses on a specific
Boolean model and tries to obtain some useful information about it.
